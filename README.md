The objective of Tetris is to score points by clearing horizontal lines of blocks. Here's how to play:

1. **Blocks (Tetriminos)**: Different shaped blocks will fall from the top of the screen.
2. **Movement**: Use the arrow keys to move and rotate the falling blocks.
3. **Clearing Lines**: Complete a horizontal line to clear it and score points.
4. **Game Over**: The game ends when the blocks stack up to the top of the screen.

### 🎮 Controls

## 💡Gameplay Tips
1. **Plan Ahead**: Always look at the "Next Piece" preview to plan your moves.
2. **Keep it Flat**: Try to maintain a flat surface - avoid creating holes.

5. **Clear Multiple Lines**: Try to clear multiple lines at once for bonus points.
6. **Stay Calm**: As the game speeds up, stay focused and think ahead.
